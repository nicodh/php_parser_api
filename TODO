1. Container objects need some kind of order management. The order of includes, class declarations, constant declarations etc. should be preserved. Only the include statements are separated in pre-includes i.e. includes that occur before the declaring of classes and post-includes that are found after the declaring of classes.

2. The API does not yet support any other statements outside of classes, namespaces and functions than includes!! Also not supported yet: Traits, Mixins
